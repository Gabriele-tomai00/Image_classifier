    # Loading test images
    folder_test = '/content/drive/MyDrive/CV_progetto2/test'
    images_test, test_labels  = load_images_labels(folder_test)
### Final note
Please keep in mind that we have worked on Colab so to avoid having to edit some paths and packages, we suggest viewing the work from Colab
